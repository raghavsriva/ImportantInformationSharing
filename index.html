	 <div>
			Important Information Sharing is a web based notes, previous year question paper, books pdf sharing and management system
			<br>
			which helps students and teachers to share their notes online effectively. It reduces the time spent by hand-distributing
			notes<br> to each person. It greatly overcomes the lack of availability and converts old school textbooks into a fully
			automated and<br> completely online-controlled system.<br>
			Important Information Sharing allows users to securely register and log in to their individual accounts and create, read, update,
			<br> and delete notes according to their needs. It provides notes for everyone in a very safe way. Many users can work on this program
			<br>simultaneously under one direction of the administrator. It is a very useful note management system for Colleges, Schools and
			<br> other institutions to manage and share their information in a safe, efficient and effective manner.
